---------------

This client makes it easy for users to communicate with the MapRoulette API from within
their Python environment. In the example below, we are able to access a MapRoulette project in just four lines of code:

   >>> import maproulette
   >>> config = maproulette.Configuration()
   >>> api = maproulette.Api(config)
   >>> api.get_project_by_id(4719)
   {'data': {'id': 4719, 'owner': 4785024, 'name': 'health_facilities_in_india',...}
